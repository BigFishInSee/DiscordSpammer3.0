# DiscordSpammer3.0
Due to large file size, project has been moved to mediafire, this repo will contain a guide and description


https://www.mediafire.com/file/qm2dptjvppa5lhv/Nuke.zip/file
The Discord Spammer can be found above, feel free to run any antivirus or anything

GUIDE:
After unzipping, head to data.txt and put in the accounts in the format of email:password, then go to chromepath.txt and put in the path to your chrome.exe. The default should work, but it is recommended to check if your chrome.exe is there. After that, open Nuke.exe and read what is written. Target URL should be the FULL URL you see when you navigate to the place you wish to spam, the rest is self explanatory. Check for cooldown in server and set accordingly. The joiner is not recommended to be used as it has not been tested. Any questions, dm me on discord: lucky_unicorn_89691 . THIS IS NOT THE FINAL VERSION, just me playing around with playwright. This version should not be handling too many accounts. The final version will release soon, which hopefully can handle at least 100 accounts and can generate them as well. The current version has no error handling whatsoever so if it closes, you messed up somewhere. DM me if any questions
